# 🚀 GraphQL Workshop Repository

Welcome to the **GraphQL Workshop Repository**, a hands-on learning experience designed to teach developers how to build **full-stack applications** using **GraphQL, Apollo Server, and React**.

This repository is structured into **three separate branches**, each focusing on a different part of the GraphQL ecosystem:

- **`apollo-start`** → Introduction to **Apollo Server** with a simple GraphQL API.
- **`book-graphql`** → A **GraphQL API** for managing books using Apollo Server.
- **`client-react`** → A **React frontend** that interacts with the Book API using Apollo Client.

This workshop is designed to be **practical and beginner-friendly**, helping developers understand the **fundamentals of GraphQL** while working with real-world examples.

## **📌 Technologies Used**

This workshop covers both **backend and frontend technologies** that are essential for building GraphQL applications.

### **Backend (GraphQL API with Apollo Server)**
✅ **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for backend development.  
✅ **Apollo Server** – GraphQL server implementation for handling queries & mutations.  
✅ **GraphQL** – Query language for fetching and managing data efficiently.  
✅ **Express.js (optional)** – For extending Apollo Server capabilities.

### **Frontend (React + Apollo Client)**
✅ **React.js** – Component-based frontend library.  
✅ **Apollo Client** – GraphQL client for managing data in React applications.  
✅ **GraphQL Queries & Mutations** – Fetching and modifying data in the UI.  
✅ **State Management** – Using Apollo Cache for optimizing performance.

Each branch in this repository focuses on integrating these technologies in a step-by-step manner.
