# ðŸ“š Apollo GraphQL Book API Example

Welcome to the **Book GraphQL API Example**! This project demonstrates how to:  
âœ… Define a **GraphQL schema** with queries & mutations  
âœ… Implement a **GraphQL API** using **Apollo Server**  
âœ… Fetch and modify book data
## ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites
Before running this example, make sure you have:
- **Node.js 18+** installed â†’ [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

Verify installation by running:
```bash
node -v    # Should return v18.x or later
npm -v     # Should return a version number
```
## âš¡ Setup & Run Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
```bash
   git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
   cd <REPO_FOLDER_NAME>
```
2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the Apollo Server
```bash
node index.js
```
After running this, you should see:
```bash
ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/
```
## ðŸ”Ž Testing the GraphQL API
1. Open Apollo Studio Sandbox or Postman
2. Enter your GraphQL API URL: http://localhost:4000/
Run the following query:
```bash
  query {
  books {
    id
    title
    author
    year
  }
}
```
âœ…Expected Response:
```bash
{
  "data": {
    "books": [
      { "id": "1", "title": "Dune", "author": "Frank Herbert", "year": 1965 },
      { "id": "2", "title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell", "year": 1949 }
    ]
  }
}
```
3. Add a New Book (Mutation)
Run this GraphQL mutation:
```bash
 mutation {
  addBook(title: "The Hobbit", author: "J.R.R. Tolkien", year: 1937) {
    id
    title
    author
    year
  }
}
```
âœ…Expected Response:
```bash
{
  "data": {
    "addBook": {
      "id": "3",
      "title": "The Hobbit",
      "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien",
      "year": 1937
    }
  }
}

```
## ðŸ›  Project Structure
```bash
ðŸ“‚ graphql-starter-project
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ backend               # Backend (GraphQL API)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ package.json      # Backend dependencies
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ index.js          # Main Apollo Server file
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ node_modules      # Installed backend dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ README.md  
```
## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
Want to extend this example? Try adding:
* âœ… A query to get a book by ID
* * âœ… A query to get  books by author
* âœ… A mutation to update or delete a book
